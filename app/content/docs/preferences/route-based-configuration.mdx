## Route based configuration

Based on the URL route, we pull the `orgName` which is useful to pull the configuration resources to build `configurationService`.

ConfigurationService methods such as `getValue` will give the merge of all the above settings in that order.

Default Configuration will be overwritten by User Configuration and User Configuration will be overwritten by Organization Configuration and follows the order for Resource Configuration.

`Resource Configuration` are related to specific `url` path within that organization that may have it's own configuration.

Here is a small example:
Organization can have multiple Teams. Each Team can have it's own Configuration. In this case, a resource configuration is created for each Team and when requesting the configuration value we need to provide the team resource URI path like:

```
getValue('organization.team.visibility', { resource: 'mongo-db-file:///team/<teamId>/settings })

--check its interface
    getValue<T>(section: string, overrides: IConfigurationOverrides): T;

```

The `overrides` parameter will take the resource and overrides the resulted organizationConfiguration with the `resourceConfiguration` value and gives the final `value`.

`orgName` is stateless and will be placed in the url for tracking the page and its configuration to be loaded.

Based on the following sample url, the route path that is used to generate is `/o/:orgName/teams/dashboard` and params value is `orgName` is `testorg`. Based on this `orgName`, we reload the configuration with `oraganizationContextService.initialize(<orgName>)` which eventually will load configurationService based on that specific organization.
