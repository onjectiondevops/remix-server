# Conditional Field Rendering - Schema Documentation

This documentation explains how to extend a schema to conditionally render a new field based on a specific condition. This example focuses on a generic schema and uses a placeholder `$newFieldCondition` for the condition.

## Introduction

You may need to conditionally display or hide a field in your data schema based on certain criteria. This document outlines the steps to add a new field to a generic schema and specify conditions for when it should be rendered.

## Updating the Schema

### Step 1: Update the Schema Object

Modify the schema object to include the new field (`newField`) at the appropriate location within the existing structure.

```javascript
export const genericSchema = {
  def: {},
  schema: {
    type: "object",
    properties: {
      existingField1: { type: "string" },
      existingField2: { type: "number" },
      // ... (other existing fields)
      newField: { type: "string" }, // New field
    },
    if: {
      properties: {
        $newFieldCondition: { const: true }, // Placeholder for the condition
      },
    },
    then: {
      properties: {
        $conditionalField: { type: "string" }, // Define the new field in 'then' when the condition is met
      },
    },
  },
};
```

### Step 2: Define the Condition

Define the condition within the `if` section. Replace the `$newFieldCondition` placeholder with the actual property and condition that should trigger the visibility of `newField`. For example:

```javascript
if: {
   properties: {
       someProperty: { const: "" }, // Example condition: newField shown when someProperty is greater than 10
   },
}
```

The `then` section specifies what properties to add when the condition is met.

## How the UI Looks

In the user interface, the appearance of the `newField` element depends on whether the specified condition is met. Here's how the UI behaves:

- **Condition Met**: When the condition, as defined in the schema (e.g., `someProperty` > 10), is satisfied, the `newField` will be rendered and displayed within the user interface. Users can interact with this field as they would with any other field.

- **Condition Not Met**: If the condition is not met, the `newField` will not be displayed in the UI. It will be hidden, and users will not see or interact with it. This behavior ensures that the UI remains user-friendly and responsive to the defined conditions.
