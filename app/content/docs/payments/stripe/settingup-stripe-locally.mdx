## Setting up stripe locally

### Handling requests from Stripe

We use `webhooks` to listen to stripe event that required to update the flow in our backend. For this
we need to make sure to run the webhook locally.

In our node server, we listen to webhook events at `/webhook/stripe` so the url will be `<backend_url>/webhook/stripe`

Follow the steps in the https://stripe.com/docs/webhooks/quickstart go to the section `Test the webhook`.

1. Update the webhook in the Stripe Developer console to it. For example `http://localhost:8080/webhook/stripe`

2. Download stripe cli and login to it

3. Now perform any plan subscription in the billing to check events are used in the node environment.
