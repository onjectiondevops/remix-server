## Procedure to deploy new version of application

## Below is the procedure to spin up a new development env in new namespace

Lets take an example of `admin-layout` project. Assuming `v1` version is already deployed in `admin-layout-v1` namespace. Now task is to deploy new env with version `v2` in `admin-layout-v2` namespace.

1. Create a new branch and update helm value file with new version number.

- Create a new branch in repo.

  `git checkout admin-layout-v2`

- Change all the values which are specific to environment. Replace all versions with `v2` version. Refer below:

```
frontend:
  env:
    CLIENT_URL: "https://idefront-admin-layout-v2.cdebase.dev"
env:
  AUTH0_CUSTOM_CLAIMS_NAMESPACE: "https://idefront-adminide-v2.cdebase.io/"
```

2. Use below options to deploy new env with Jenkins job.

- Set `version of the deployment` to `v2`
- Set `the branch of repository` to `admin-layout-v2`

  ![Jenkins_Job2](/images/app-deploy-new-version/jenkins2.PNG)

Note: The version number should be different. Otherwise it will override the existing setup.
