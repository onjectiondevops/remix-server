## Xstate

for example we name actions in such a way that common one are shared ...

`updateXXXX` -> updates the context, uses assign function

`saveXXXX` -> Save to database; it is unique to server and client

`handleXXX` -> it is some third party calls, it is unique to server and client

and we have context `processing` this is where changes that need for next action dependency.
For example we need to save some updates to reservation will be saved as `processing.changesToSave` and if action sequence has saveToDatabase then it will look for it and save.
