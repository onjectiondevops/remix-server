## Coding Guidelines


## Intro

These are CDEBase coding guidelines. Please also review our [Source Code Organisation](./source-code-organization.md) page.

## Indentation
We use tabs, not spaces.

## Names
* Use PascalCase for `type` names
* Use PascalCase for `enum` values. If the `enums` generated from Graphql codegen then it should follow Graphql code style convention.
* Use camelCase for `function` and `method` names
* Use camelCase for `property` names and `local variables`
* Use whole words in names when possible

## Naming for Files and Directories
* Name files after their default export. If that default export is a React Component, or a class, then the file name should be in `PascalCase`.
* Otherwise, the filename should be in `camelCase`.
* For naming files avoid using `kebab-case` and `snake_case` and make sure the name follows the default export of the file.
* Naming directories should follow `kebab-case`. Except use `PascalCase` for directories when containing only React components:

```
components/CtaButton/index.ts
import 'components/CtaButton'
```

or

```
components/CtaButton/CtaButton.tsx
import 'components/CtaButton/CtaButton'
```
rather than

```
components/cta-button/CtaButton.tsx
```

## Import files order
### browser side import order
- react import (if it is .tsx file)
- react based packages like react-redux, react-fela, chakra-ui ...
- npm packages for js utils
- @common, @admin, @pubngo packages..
- ../../../package
- ../../folder/
- ./Component

### server side import order is similar like
- node packages first
- @common-stack, @cdm, @pubngo ...
- import from local path by far path first and near folder next

## Types
* Do not export `types` or `functions` unless you need to share it across multiple components
* Do not introduce new `types` or `values` to the global namespace

## Comments
* Use JSDoc style comments for `functions`, `interfaces`, `enums`, and `classes`

## Strings
* Use "double quotes" for strings shown to the user that need to be externalized (localized)
* Use 'single quotes' otherwise
* All strings visible to the user need to be externalized

## Style
* Use arrow functions `=>` over anonymous function expressions
* Only surround arrow function parameters when necessary. For example, `(x) => x + x` is wrong but the following are correct:

```javascript
x => x + x
(x, y) => x + y
<T>(x: T, y: T) => x === y
```

* Always surround loop and conditional bodies with curly braces
* Open curly braces always go on the same line as whatever necessitates them
* Parenthesized constructs should have no surrounding whitespace. A single space follows commas, colons, and semicolons in those constructs. For example:

```javascript
for (let i = 0, n = str.length; i < 10; i++) {
    if (x < 10) {
        foo();
    }
}

function f(x: number, y: string): void { }
```
