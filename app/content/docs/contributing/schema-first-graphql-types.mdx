## Schema First Graphql Types

We use [GraphQL Code Generator](https://github.com/dotansimha/graphql-code-generator) to generate `types`.

The `graphql` schema is designed first and placed in the `server` side package.

We don't place any built-in `query or mutation or subscription` within the Component. Instead we add the `queries` or `mutations` or `subscriptions` under `graphql` folder in the clien package (either on `browser` or `client` package). These will have `.gql` extension.

The generated Wrapper component will be used in the component. The generated files can be determined by looking into `codegen.yaml` file which is at the `root` of the project.

## To update to exising Graphql Schema follow the steps.

1. Update the Graphql Schema first with required methods.

2. Generate Graphql Types by running `npm run genreateGraphql`

3. The generated code usually added to `<@sample-stack>/core` package and this package should be imported to use it. In order to auto build when the files changes in the package, make sure `watch` is run on that package.

4. Write `resolvers` for the `Mutations | Query | Subscription` that are defined in the graphql schema.
