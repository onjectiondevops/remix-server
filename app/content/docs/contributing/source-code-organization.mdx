## Source Code Organization

Fullstack code consists of a layered and modular 


# Layers
- `packages`: The base packages required for project.
- `packages-modules`: The entry point to core application based feature. An extended features to the `packages`.
  - It may have dependencies of `packages`
  - It wont' have any dependency of any of other modules within `packages-modules` except if it is a `core` package.
- `servers`: The entry point to server app for remote development. 
  - It has dependencies of `packages-modules`'s packages and/or `packages` 
- `portable-devices`: The entry point to native apps like mobile and deskop.
  - It has dependencies of `packages-modules`'s packages and/or `packages`.

# Target Environments
The `module` is partitioned into the following sub packages:
- `platform`: Defines service injection support and the base services for the Project that are shared accross layers
- `core`: Source code that only requires basic JavaScript APIs and run in all the other target environments
- `clent`: Source code that only requires basic Client APIs such as `redux`, `redux-epic`, `apollo-client`, `hooks` without requiring Web APIs like `react`, `dom` etc.
- `browser`: Source code that requires [Web APIs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API), eg. DOM, React
  - may have dependencies on: `core`, `client`
- `server`: Source code that requires [Node.JS](https://nodejs.org) APIs
  - may have dependencies on: `core`
- `mobile`: Source code the requires [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/)
- `electron`: Source code that requires the [Electron renderer-process](https://github.com/atom/electron/tree/master/docs#modules-for-the-renderer-process-web-page) APIs
  - may have dependencies on: `core`, `browser`, `client`
- `electron-main`: Source code that requires the [Electron main-process](https://github.com/atom/electron/tree/master/docs#modules-for-the-main-process) APIs
  - may have dependencies on: `core`, `node`
- `browser-extension`: Source code that requires the [Chrome Extension](https://developer.chrome.com/docs/extensions/)
- `extension`: Source code of extension

You can add additional `target environments` based on the specific third party library
- `ant-ui`: Source code that requires the [antd components](https://ant.design/components/overview/)
- `chakra-ui`: Source code that requires the [Chakra-UI components](https://chakra-ui.com/docs/components)

# Build and Run 

We use [lerna](./lerna-build-tools.md) to compile the packages. Read more about it as it is needed to run the project.
